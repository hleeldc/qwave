/// WaveformSelectionProxy manages a region called "selection" on registered waveforms.
/**
   Selection is a region on a waveform that currently has the focus.
   A selection can be created by clicking on a waveform with the left mouse
   button, dragging the mouse and releasing the button.  This mouse motion
   can also be emulated by calling beginSelection, expandSelection and
   freezeSelection methods in the order.  Finally, a selection can also be
   created by calling the select method.

   We call the waveform on which the selection is drawn focused waveform.
   Other waveforms that are registered are called unfocused waveform.

   Slection is drawn as a red rectangle on the focused waveform widget.
   Yellow rectangles with the same span as the selection rectangle are also
   drawn on unfocused waveforms.  We call these yellow rectangles unfocused
   regions.  This color scheme can be changed with the setColorScheme method.

   The focused waveform can be obtained using the getSelectedWaveform method.

   The start time and duration of the selection can be obtained with
   getBeginSeconds and getWidthSeconds methods respectively.
