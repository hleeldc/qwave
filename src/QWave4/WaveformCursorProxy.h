   A red vertical bar is drawn at the x position of the mouse on the waveform
   on which the mouse pointer is. This waveform is called focused waveform,
   and the red bar is called focused cursor.  Other registered waveforms are
   called unfocused waveforms and yellow vertical bars are drawn on them at the
   same x position as the focused bar.  These yellow bars are called unfocused
   cursors.

   There is another type of cursor: player cursor.  When the
   WaveformCursorProxy object is registered with a SndPlayerTicker object,
   this green vertical cursors are drawn to indicate where the SndPlayer
   is playing.  Player cursors are drawn on all waveforms currently registered.
  
   The color scheme of the focused/unfocused cursors can be changed with
   the setColorScheme method.  The cursor position can be obtained using the
   getCursorPositionSeconds method.
