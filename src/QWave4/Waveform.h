/// Waveform provides a drawing area on which waveform is drawn.
/**
   It also provides a QCanvas that can be used to overlay user defined
   graphics on top of the waveform.  This canvas can be obtained using
   the getCanvas method.  This canvas is used by QWave4 to draw
   cursors and marked regions.

   A typical usage of the Waveform class looks like this.
     
   <pre>
   SndFile sndfile("speech.wav");
   QVBox vbox;
   Waveform waveform1(&sndfile, 0, 12.3, 1.1, &vbox);
   Waveform waveform2(&sndfile, 1, 12.3, 1.1, &vbox);</pre>

   This code snipet loads a 2-channel sound file (speech.wav), creates
   a QVBox, add Waveforms for each channel to the QVBox.  Initially, the
   region [12.3,13.4] is drawn, and this fills the Waveforms.  Different
   region can be drawn later using the Waveform::display method.

   <pre>
   waveform1.display(13.4, 1.5);
   waveform2.display(13.4, 1.5);</pre>
