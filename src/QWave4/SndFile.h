/// SndFile represents a sound file.
/**
   It is designed to be an efficient "waveform drawer" for the
   Waveform class rather than to be used to access samples in the
   sound file.  Therefore, the name of this class is somewhat
   misleading because you cannot access any samples of the sound file
   through this class.
   
   <pre>
   SndFile sndfile("speech.wav");
   Waveform waveform(&sndfile, 0);  // waveform for the first channel (0) 
                                    // of the speech.wav file</pre>

   QWave4 uses the libsndfile library (http://...) to access the sound
   file.  Thus, QWave4 supports whatever sound file format libsndfile
   supports.

   For faster access of audio samples, this class implements a cache
   with round-robin paging.  Each page of the cache amounts to 1
   second of sample frames.  The cacheSize parameter of the
   constructor determines the total number of pages in the cache and
   it defaults to 120.  It's about 4 MB if you are loading a
   two-channel PCM file with 16-bit samples sampled at 8 KHz.
   Although 4 MB is not a small amount of memory, it will bring
   considerable speed-ups in some situations, for example, when the
   waveform is scrolled continuously and contiguously.

   If SndFile is not used for waveform display, i.e. if it
   is not used with Waveform or, more specifically, if
   SndFile::drawWaveform is not called at all in the program, the
   cache is not used at all.  In this case, the cacheSize parameter
   can be set to 0 to save some memory.

   <pre>
   PLAYERIMPLEMENTATION player(2, 8000);
   SndFile sndfile("music.wav", 0);
   player.addSndFile(&sndfile);
   player.play(0.0, sndfile.getLengthSeconds());</pre>

     to the length of the sound file.  If dur is larger than the cache size
     (120 seconds by default), it will be reset to the cache size.

     Where the waveform is drawn is determined by the geometry of the
     the Waveform.  This method will try to draw
     the waveform on the drawing area of the Waveform, even though the
